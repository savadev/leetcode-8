/*
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. 
Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
*/

-- people in Order tables have at least 1 order
-- on the other hand, people not in Order never order anything
select Name
from Customers
where ID NOT IN (select CustomerId from Orders);
